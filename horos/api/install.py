"""ML-stack install planning: `horos install` (E4/§4 continued).

`pip install horos` ships only the lightweight core (datasets, annotation,
web UI). The ML stack — torch, rfdetr, transformers — deliberately stays out
of the base dependencies, because its correct source is platform-specific in
ways pip's static metadata cannot express:

  * Windows: the PyPI torch wheel is CPU-only; a CUDA machine must install
    from the matching download.pytorch.org index.
  * Linux without a GPU: the CPU index saves ~2 GB of CUDA libraries.
  * Jetson: torch must be NVIDIA's JetPack-matched wheel; a PyPI torch
    silently replaces it with a CPU build (§4).
  * AMD GPUs: there is no AMD build on PyPI at all. torch comes from AMD's
    own ROCm index, and the wheel is per-GPU-architecture, so the gfx
    target is detected before the install.

`plan_install()` inspects the live environment (what is installed, whether an
NVIDIA driver is present and which CUDA version it supports, whether an AMD
GPU is present) and produces the ordered pip commands that close the gap. The
CLI (`horos install`) prints and executes them; `horos doctor` reuses the same
plan for its fix commands.

R1: this module never imports torch — it reads installed-package metadata,
runs nvidia-smi and reads the PCI device list, nothing more.
